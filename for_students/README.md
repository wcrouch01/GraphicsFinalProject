Notes to the Grader:

# Questions for Assignment 11 and 12

Note: There questions are designed to help you document what you've done in your assignment. It is important as this is the way we will understand what you have done for grading.

An example of filled in questions is in the `Examples` directory (`QUESTIONS-example.md`).

## Assignment 11

The rubric has a list of 13 items.

Item 2: List at least 3 distinct behaviors. If you have made more than 3, list up to 5 and choose the ones you think are most interesting. A single sentence describing each one should be sufficient.

2.A: Construction equipment rotating and lowering equipment (wire for crane and shovel for excavator)
2.B: Buses moving around the map on roads and hitting banked curves (also move with arc-length parameterization)
2.C: Swings swinging
2.D: Playground equipment spinning
2.E: Plane follows a 3D path in the sky

Item 3: Do you have a spline train track? What object should we look at? How do we know it's a spline?
I do not have a spline track. Look at the train that runs on the circular track

Item 4: Do you have a train that faces forward on the track and is ridable?
Yes. It is labeled Train, faces forward, and rides on a circular track

Optional Complexity Points: For each one that you've done, give the number (5-13) on the list, describe the behavior, and tell us what object we can see it on. This might take 2-3 sentences per item.

5: The plane follows a 3D path and banks appropiately. Click on the "Plane" item to view it. The plane goes in a square path, banks the turn on each corner, and on two of the sides of the square lowers and raises its elevation.
11: There is a driving system. The buses all follow their own path and never collide. The buses even have arc-length parameterization. To view them, view any of bus-# objects.
7: The construction equipment has multiple behaviors. The wire Rotates, lowers the wire, retracts the wire, and repeats. The excavator lowers its arm, raises its arm, then rotates and moves at the same time.

List which other "Behavior Challenges" you completed (from the list of 13 - anything 5 and above). For each, give the number as well as a short (1 sentence is OK) description. And tell us where in the world to see it (what object should we "lookat" and/or "ride"):


## Assignment 12

Object Diversity: List 8 of the different kinds of objects that appear in your world. If you made more than 8 kinds of objects, only list the 8 that are most interesting visually.

O.1 The Tall buildings
O.2 The Medium size buildings
O.3 The trees
O.4 The excavator
O.5 The Crane
O.6 The plane (quadcopter)
O.7 The Train
O.8 The Helicopter

Object Diversity: list one object in your world that is loaded from a model file (e.g., OBJ or FBX). Remember to give proper attribution in your README file, and to include the object in your repository.

The Buses and People are loaded in as FBX files.

Object Diversity: list one of each category
Building: Tall Buildings
Natural Element: Tree
Vehicle (object meant to move): Bus

Technical Challenges: For each technical challenge you attempted (from the list of 7), give the number of the challenge, a description of what you did, and a description of the object that it was used on. What objects should we "look at".
7: I added a skybox to the world. The skybox is a scaled version of the entire world. Its very visually appealing because you get to see everything else massive compared to you.
4: Tree branches are generated randomly for the small trees.
Pictures: confirm that you placed the required pictures in the Pictures directory.
The required picutures are in the Pictures folder.
Consent: do you agree to allow us to use your pictures in future gallery pages? (please answer Yes or No)
Yes
